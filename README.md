# ClubGPT
ClubGPT - coding companion, Think Tank from GPTs

## Introduction
Welcome to the ClubGPT Coding Team Project repository!
ClubGPT has an unique approach to deliver complete solutions (in this case SW) by emulating a dream team (multiple agents) that ships (tested project as a ZIP file). This project simulates a software development team, where multiple roles collaborate to create a full-fledged software application. The team comprises a Product Manager, two Software Developers, a QA Engineer, and an optional AI UX/UI Designer. Their goal is to build an application that can be downloaded as a ZIP file and executed.

The development process is iterative, with each team member contributing their expertise.

## Tools and Features

- Team of multiple agents: Product owner, Developers, QA engineer(!), UI Designer roles
- Code Interpreter: Used by Developers and QA Engineers to run and test code.
- Creates a task list and able to follow it to achieve a complete solution without further info (just say next) 
- Works in My Files, so has knowledge retrieval and able to work iteratively - storing and updating project files.
- UI Mockup Generation: For creating and refining UI designs.
- In case of UI you can send screenshots as feedback and the team will react accordingly (fix bugs)
- Hot keys are available for quick navigation (for instructions and team members).
- Cheaper than using Assistant API ðŸ˜œ (free with ChatGPT Plus subscription) 
- Download final product as a ZIP

## Hot Keys

s: show last file
t: show task list, update progress if needed
r: run code and test
