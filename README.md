# ClubGPT
ClubGPT - coding companion, Think Tank from GPTs

## Introduction
Welcome to the ClubGPT Coding Team Project repository! This project simulates a software development team environment, where multiple roles collaborate to create a full-fledged software application. The team comprises a Product Manager, two Software Developers, a QA Engineer, and an optional AI UX/UI Designer. Their goal is to build an application that can be downloaded as a ZIP file and executed.

The development process is iterative, with each team member contributing their expertise.
Hot keys are available for quick navigation (e.g., p for Product Manager, d for Developer).

## Tools and Features
My Files: A repository for storing and updating project files.
Code Interpreter: Used by Developers and QA Engineers to run and test code.
UI Mockup Generation: For creating and refining UI designs.
